# au-digitalhealth-base-template
The purpose of this repository is to contain FHIR implementation guide template styling that adds Australian Digital Health Agency specific branding (like logo, colours, links).  

It will directly inherit from the International HL7 IG Template (https://github.com/HL7/ig-template-base) which a includes all of the scripts, layouts, etc. to produce a FHIR implementation guide.
