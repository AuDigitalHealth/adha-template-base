# adha-template-base
The purpose of this repository is to contain FHIR implementation guide template styling that adds Australian Digital Health Agency specific branding (like logo, colours, links).  

It will directly inherit from the HL7 International IG Template Base (https://github.com/HL7/ig-template-base) which includes all of the scripts, layouts, etc. to produce a FHIR implementation guide. It is intended to serve as a base for most Agency HL7-style implementation guide publications.
